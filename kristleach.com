Researcher, designer, so what?
This is a site where Iâ€™ll be learning-out-loud about damn near everything.
I decided to use my research and design skills to first learn more about things I care about, and then to contribute to those things.
This is the list I ended up with:
	•	Visual design - restaurant menus
	•	Feminism
	•	Business (MBA)
	•	Interaction design
	•	Computer science
	•	SharePoint (sigh)
	•	Quantitative research
	•	Statistics
	•	Sample sizes
	•	Experiment design
	•	Git
	•	PGP
	•	RWD
	•	Healthcare
	•	My employerâ€™s] clients
	•	Chicagoâ€™s industries
	•	What helps women succeed?
	•	What helps people heal from trauma?
	•	What makes people strong?
	•	National politics
	•	Congress
	•	Illinois politics
	•	Web development
	•	Chicago politics
	•	Sustainable agriculture
	•	Publishing processes/CMS
	•	Data analysis
	•	Data mining
	•	Wine
	•	Beer
	•	Songwriting
	•	Voice
	•	Guitar
	•	Logical fallacies
	•	Cognitive biases
	•	What helps people make the most of their lives? (Thanks, Sara Wachter-Boettcher, for the question.)
	•	American Indian reservations
	•	Haiti
This list is embarrassing, if you consider it one way. Maybe endearing, from other perspectives? Ugh.
Well, some of these are more important than others. Some of these are a means to other things on the list.
Which is how I am starting to view research and design and writing. They can be beautiful (especially writing, <3 you, words), but they are primarily means to an end.
So, now what?
