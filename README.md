Ah, so many plans for this site. Learn to deploy from the command line, learn to use Creative Suite with Git, learn how to use a responsive framework...For now, it will be a few, static HTML files and MAYBE a css file, if I can manage it. Slither, crawl, walk, et al.

What needs to happen first, though, is that I need to get something up at kristileach.com. I'm launching my business next week, and I need to move quickly with getting ideas out and in front of people. I need an internet home. I have distributed homes, of course. Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn. I worry this will be a distraction. But I keep moving toward it: paying for the domain, signing up for Github, drooling over responsive web design and atomic design and content strategy. Why? I aim to find out.
