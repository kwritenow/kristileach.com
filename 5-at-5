Our Research & Analysis group at Perficient had an end-of-week ritual we called 5 @ 5. It was how our distributed team shared victories and accomplishments and snippets of our personal lives. There was general amnesty for being late, or having not-exactly-five things. It was nourishing, and I'm gonna keep doing it here.

* Spent a few days in MKE helping my sister get ready to move. It's like camping, but on a couch, and with four homecooked meals a day. It was sweet to see the house they plan to stay in while the kids are in school. I helped paint my nephew's bedroom, and we thought about how he'll probably paint and decorate it again at least once before he moves out. Those sweet kiddos are my favorites!
* Allergy attack! Ugh.
* New networking groups, new friends-in-other-contexts...so many new people and projects. On the one hand, my progress has not been very focused. On the other hand, that's supposed to be the point of this time. To explore, and to ultimately be more sure in my direction. Trusting the plan. Plan made, plan working...
* The first episode of the Women in Design podcast is recorded, and we have a themesong that is approved for us to use, should we choose to. 
* I'm starting a new Friday-in-the-Loop happy hour, and today exactly one person is joining me. Last time it was just me! Which is fine, because the most important part is that I talk to strangers. It's good practice with small talk, and talking about what I do without trying to sell, necessarily. And the invitation part is about making sure I have people in my network whose company I enjoy. So, all is as it should be.

* I was accepted to work at 1871. It took a few weeks to hear back from them, and if that weren't the case, I probably would have already paid them and joined. Now, though, I'm not feeling as confident about money. Hmm, that's an interesting choice of words. Here's another choice: I'm being more cautious so that I can have more freedom. During our strategy sessions, we didn't decide on startups as a major focus. Besides, it isn't difficult to bump into a startup founder in Chicago.
* Networking has yielded my first scheduled meeting. I also started work on our industry-specific content. And I'm editing the first episode of the Women in Design podcast.
* I'm back in the Tuesday rhythm of Chi Hack Night. Not to mention the Slack rhythm. It's like Twitter, but with people I actually converse with.
* I am sleep deprived and moving slowly, as a result. Early mornings and late nights do not go well together.
* I volunteered at a Summit of Hope for people on parole. It did not feel like an event that was overly concerned with preserving the dignity of attendees. I want to talk to someone more knowledgeable about this. I wish I had realized earlier what felt wrong about it, so that I could have adjusted and made more out of it. I observed, and I walked with a total of five people around the tables, and then I decided I was too tired and rushed for time to stay the final hour and a half. But I wrote about it, and I'm still processing. The next thing I'll write is my notes for the Access to Justice group, and that will help.

* I'm officially moving forward as part of Hopscotch Labs. I'm working to get us projects in the Midwest. So, I'm practicing talking about our relationship, our work, how out work can serve our potential clients. 
* There is a lot of supporting work around this--building my site, updating business cards, updating Hopscotch's site--but what really needs to happen now is to start asking people for meetings to hear about us. Time to start emailing on Monday morning.
* This is also supposed to be time for me to read up and take classes and start writing about the topics I care about, and I am finding that I am drawn to spending time on that, but getting gigs and setting up an impressive online presence is urgent. I am going to have to set aside reading and writing until that is done.
* Very busy with networking--the calendar is starting to turn into a patchwork of meetups and Access to Justice events. This week was a lesson in awkward as I learn how to be salesperson without being obnoxious, and to not be obnoxious without missing opportunities. The really satisfying and relieving part is that when I get anxious, I get to remind myself that it's now my job to be at ease, and to take care of myself. So I get to practice those things.
* Got to the gym a few times. Feels good!

##2/26/2016
* I had a couple of days off, part of the time due to being under the weather. Once the nausea passed, that wasn't terrible. Watching every episode of Chelsea Handler's new show in my pajamas was a useful decompression. Missing Chi Hack Night didn't feel good, but necessary is necessary.
* I got plenty of processing time to think about what might be workable as a partnership with my friend in San Diego.
* I had my first mentoring call. Healthcare, medical devices--what's the best way to talk with people who might need to hire innovation, service design, or user experience expertise for medical devices, or hospitals, or connected health? There are about a thousand more conversations to be had on these topics. I'm grateful for this one, and for the friendly voice.
* Have you ever crashed a conference? I have. For the STC Summit in Dallas in 2010, I stayed with family in Burleson and Fort Worth while attending outside networking events and special interest group meetings. Point being, I couldn't afford to register, but I still tried to get something out of it. I'm considering whether to do that for the HIMMS conference in Las Vegas, or whether to just fork over the precious dollars to register and be fully immersed. One ting that's different is that HIMMS is very new to me. I'm not a registered, participating member, yet. And this is quite spur-of-the-moment. 
* I'm in Milwaukee at my sister's place. I did a networking thing, and I'm working, and I also took my nephew to the Public Museum. Freedom!

##2/19/2016
So much of this week has required me to sort it between brutally-educational and useful, with little falling into the category of straightforwardly-good or bad. 
* I facilitated part of a lunch-and-learn. The lunch and learn was both expensive and well-received. It seems to me the feat is in remaining calm in the midst of such gambling without a paycheck. I mean, besides being excellent in the material.
* San Diego is a trip and a half. Its geography and plantlife are stunningly-beautiful. Familiar, in large part, because of my time in Florida, but without the humidity and without the trailer parks. SD is fucking expensive, and its techies are more nakedly-hierarchichal than in the Midwest. Per nothing but my biased observations. 
* So much unsolicited advice. So much. 
* On the flip side, trust more, love more. Like, for instance, I could trust that I wouldn't be here in San Diego if I wasn't loved enough to be invited.
* There are some definitely-good things left to mention in this week: another workshop, hill runs, great food, a podcast in the works. 

##2/12/2016

* I'm in San Diego, staying in an RV and working with my friend Kris Angell for Hopscotch Labs. I'm helping with some workshops she has coming up, and we're exploring what it would look like for me to be part of Hopscotch as an ongoing thing. 
* I am now self-employed, and I am alternately drunk with freedom and paralyzed with terror. A good friend has assured me this means I am doing it right, and I choose to believe her.
* Working with a new team to establish roles out of thin air is not always comfortable. I am grateful for my gracious, kind, generous, ethical collaborators. What we are doing can have the direct effect of making each other's dreams come true, or just improving our circumstances a little. That's humbling and very motivating.
* I am seeing the city in bite-sized chunks. Walking and running in the neighborhood around the RV (South Park and North Park), riding out to Mission Hills for a session with a partner, grabbing lunch near Kris's coworking space downtown. This weekend, I plan to get over to the beach. Meanwhile, it was 10 degrees in Chicago yesterday.
* My dad found the first car to buy for our car-flipping venture, and his side-job in Florida is going well. (My parents recently moved to Milwaukee to be near us daughters, and getting re-established is taking some time.) First steps in something I hope we will grow.

Happy Friday, y'all. <3
