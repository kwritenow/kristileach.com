Our Research & Analysis group at Perficient had an end-of-week ritual we called 5 @ 5. It was how our distributed team shared victories and accomplishments and snippets of our personal lives. There was general amnesty for being late, or having not-exactly-five things. It was nourishing, and I'm gonna keep doing it here.

So much of this week has required me to sort it between brutally-educational and useful, with little falling into the category of straightforwardly-good or bad. 
* I facilitated part of a lunch-and-learn. The lunch and learn was both expensive and well-received. It seems to me the feat is in remaining calm in the midst of such gambling without a paycheck. I mean, besides being excellent in the material.
* San Diego is a trip and a half. Its geography and plantlife are stunningly-beautiful. Familiar, in large part, because of my time in Florida, but without the humidity and without the trailer parks. SD is fucking expensive, and its techies are more nakedly-hierarchichal than in the Midwest. Per nothing but my biased observations. 
* So much unsolicited advice. So much. 
* On the flip side, trust more, love more. Like, for instance, I could trust that I wouldn't be here in San Diego if I wasn't loved enough to be invited.
* There are some definitely-good things left to mention in this week: another workshop, hill runs, great food, a podcast in the works.

* I'm in San Diego, staying in an RV and working with my friend Kris Angell for Hopscotch Labs. I'm helping with some workshops she has coming up, and we're exploring what it would look like for me to be part of Hopscotch as an ongoing thing. 
* I am now self-employed, and I am alternately drunk with freedom and paralyzed with terror. A good friend has assured me this means I am doing it right, and I choose to believe her.
* Working with a new team to establish roles out of thin air is not always comfortable. I am grateful for my gracious, kind, generous, ethical collaborators. What we are doing can have the direct effect of making each other's dreams come true, or just improving our circumstances a little. That's humbling and very motivating.
* I am seeing the city in bite-sized chunks. Walking and running in the neighborhood around the RV (South Park and North Park), riding out to Mission Hills for a session with a partner, grabbing lunch near Kris's coworking space downtown. This weekend, I plan to get over to the beach. Meanwhile, it was 10 degrees in Chicago yesterday.
* My dad found the first car to buy for our car-flipping venture, and his side-job in Florida is going well. (My parents recently moved to Milwaukee to be near us daughters, and getting re-established is taking some time.) First steps in something I hope we will grow.

Happy Friday, y'all. <3
