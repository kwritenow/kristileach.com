Our Research & Analysis group at Perficient had an end-of-week ritual we called 5 @ 5. It was how our distributed team shared victories and accomplishments and snippets of our personal lives. There was general amnesty for being late, or having not-exactly-five things. It was nourishing, and I'm gonna keep doing it here.

* I had a couple of days off, part of the time due to being under the weather. Once the nausea passed, that wasn't terrible. Watching every episode of Chelsea Handler's new show in my pajamas was a useful decompression. Missing Chi Hack Night didn't feel good, but necessary is necessary.
* I got plenty of processing time to think about what might be workable as a partnership with my friend in San Diego.
* I had my first mentoring call. Healthcare, medical devices--what's the best way to talk with people who might need to hire innovation, service design, or user experience expertise for medical devices, or hospitals, or connected health? There are about a thousand more conversations to be had on these topics. I'm grateful for this one, and for the friendly voice.
* Have you ever crashed a conference? I have. For the STC Summit in Dallas in 2010, I stayed with family in Burleson and Fort Worth while attending outside networking events and special interest group meetings. I'm considering whether to do that for the HIMMS conference in Las Vegas, or whether to just fork over the precious dollars to register and be fully immersed.
* I'm in Milwaukee at my sister's place. I did a networking thing, and I'm working, and I also took my nephew to the Public Museum. Freedom!

So much of this week has required me to sort it between brutally-educational and useful, with little falling into the category of straightforwardly-good or bad. 
* I facilitated part of a lunch-and-learn. The lunch and learn was both expensive and well-received. It seems to me the feat is in remaining calm in the midst of such gambling without a paycheck. I mean, besides being excellent in the material.
* San Diego is a trip and a half. Its geography and plantlife are stunningly-beautiful. Familiar, in large part, because of my time in Florida, but without the humidity and without the trailer parks. SD is fucking expensive, and its techies are more nakedly-hierarchichal than in the Midwest. Per nothing but my biased observations. 
* So much unsolicited advice. So much. 
* On the flip side, trust more, love more. Like, for instance, I could trust that I wouldn't be here in San Diego if I wasn't loved enough to be invited.
* There are some definitely-good things left to mention in this week: another workshop, hill runs, great food, a podcast in the works.

* I'm in San Diego, staying in an RV and working with my friend Kris Angell for Hopscotch Labs. I'm helping with some workshops she has coming up, and we're exploring what it would look like for me to be part of Hopscotch as an ongoing thing. 
* I am now self-employed, and I am alternately drunk with freedom and paralyzed with terror. A good friend has assured me this means I am doing it right, and I choose to believe her.
* Working with a new team to establish roles out of thin air is not always comfortable. I am grateful for my gracious, kind, generous, ethical collaborators. What we are doing can have the direct effect of making each other's dreams come true, or just improving our circumstances a little. That's humbling and very motivating.
* I am seeing the city in bite-sized chunks. Walking and running in the neighborhood around the RV (South Park and North Park), riding out to Mission Hills for a session with a partner, grabbing lunch near Kris's coworking space downtown. This weekend, I plan to get over to the beach. Meanwhile, it was 10 degrees in Chicago yesterday.
* My dad found the first car to buy for our car-flipping venture, and his side-job in Florida is going well. (My parents recently moved to Milwaukee to be near us daughters, and getting re-established is taking some time.) First steps in something I hope we will grow.

Happy Friday, y'all. <3
