<p>Kristi Leach: Researcher, designer, so what?</p>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a site where I'll be learning-out-loud about damn near everything.</p>
<p>I decided to use my research and design skills to first learn more about things I care about, and then to contribute to those things.</p>
<p>This is the list I ended up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual design - restaurant menus</li>
<li>Feminism</li>
<li>Business (MBA)</li>
<li>Interaction design</li>
<li>Computer science</li>
<li>SharePoint (sigh)</li>
<li>Quantitative research</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Sample sizes</li>
<li>Experiment design</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>PGP</li>
<li>RWD</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>My employer's] clients</li>
<li>Chicago's industries</li>
<li>What helps women succeed?</li>
<li>What helps people heal from trauma?</li>
<li>What makes people strong?</li>
<li>National politics</li>
<li>Congress</li>
<li>Illinois politics</li>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Chicago politics</li>
<li>Sustainable agriculture</li>
<li>Publishing processes/CMS</li>
<li>Data analysis</li>
<li>Data mining</li>
<li>Wine</li>
<li>Beer</li>
<li>Songwriting</li>
<li>Voice</li>
<li>Guitar</li>
<li>Logical fallacies</li>
<li>Cognitive biases</li>
<li>What helps people make the most of their lives? (Thanks, Sara Wachter-Boettcher, for the question.)</li>
<li>American Indian reservations</li>
<li>Haiti</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is embarrassing, if you consider it one way. Maybe endearing, from other perspectives? Ugh.</p>
<p>Well, some of these are more important than others. Some of these are a means to other things on the list.</p>
<p>Which is how I am starting to view research and design and writing. They can be beautiful (especially writing, <3 you, words), but they are primarily means to an end.</p>
<p>So, now what?</p>
