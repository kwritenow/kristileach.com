<p>Neighbors wake me talking and laughing at 3:06. It was around three last Friday. So, they go to a three o'clock bar, I guess. Then they wake me again at six having sex. How do they wait three hours to have sex? Are they doing coke? How many of the are there? They wake me up again; a man's shout, my neighbor, "What now? What now?" and then someone opens his door. Locks it. Gets on the elevator. What could have happened? What now? I stay in bed another hour, turning over into the cool sheets. I feel strong, though my guts are twisting. I remember the dishes are still piled up, and try to plunge back into sleep.</p> 

<p>Or I'll get up, be in the day, run or walk everywhere, not shut up afraid with the shades down, cowering because my job is boring and I'm afraid I can't do it and I'll be fired and feel ashamed. I'm already ashamed of being a liar and a cheat. Yet everyone is forgiving me, in advance.</p> 

<p>Meanwhile, Lady Gaga has young artists playing her songs in tribute. They are giving her awards for her passion. There's an article about artists reaching down to play with what fascinates and ails them. What am I doing wrong that my passion is really my anxiety, and it puts me in bed or in the bar?</p>

<p> Is this what Kristin Hersh meant when she said the branches were wet in the yard outside her German hotel? The bark is spongy cork saturated with already-old rain. The branches kiss and smack and tap and are still whispers, somehow. Drops roll off the tear-shaped leaves, but everything is still waving lightly. The slowing water weight is there but shedding already; the drunken bob is still innocent. Guileless. Eyeless. Shit is not about you. There's no sadness in it. The waterlogging is just inevitable. There's not even enough tension to call it that. It's just dumb. Still, utterly inoffensive. No one is hurt. Nothing is ruffled. Shake, shake, shaken dry, then dry pores open again to whatever has accumulated in the smog above, or blown in from over the wide open lake. Make me drunk with lake, again. That's just fine.</p>

<p>While I'm here, I should probably try to notice what this city is about. Is it theatre? Comedy? Music? Industry? It's not the dubious newspaper. It doesn't feel like Printer's Row, though we've got the story clubs, and the writers soaking it in on stools in all the best neighborhoods. Is it the startup scene? How many Meetups are we up to? How long do I have to find out?</p>

<p>I'm apparently done enjoying the clarity of of an unspoiled Saturday early morning, because I'm ready to be high. Maybe it was the coffee pushed me up out of it. Now my undercurrent is hungry worried belly. Low hum of dissatisfaction. It probably just means I need to walk for hours. Lack of physical power discharge. I'd be rained on, I can see, and anyway, I'm not allowed, because of everything I'm cheating on. I'm stuck clicking away from it forever, ass in chair, missing out on what this city is really about. It isn't fair, it isn't fair. I'll never be the person starting the Midnight Club of Everything We Already Make Ourselves Do All Day. That's all I have to say in my monthly employment check in. Boss, I'll never be that kind of Thought Leader, so stop asking.</p>

<p>It's so grey outside, it's blue. My sheets are blue, the cat is blue black, the yellow leaves are green and waving, light chatter about air traffic. We're all swimming, here, in our lanes. Now the rain comes, and we go quiet writing about it. You know we're here by the tap and smack of our fingers, and we know we're together. Monday's transmissions, Tuesday's installments. Print the reports on blue grey pages, another sheaf in the tray, warmth and the smell of ink radiating off the copier.</p> 

<p>What I tell my belly is if I'm high I can't keep up. I tell my lungs and my legs there's a race in my screen. I tell them everyone is forgiving me, and my ass sliding in this seat is what it looks like. Apparently, if I'm going to transmit continuously, it'll have to be this.</p>
