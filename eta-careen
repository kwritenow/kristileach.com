<p>Kristi Leach: Researcher, designer, so what?</p>
</head>
<body>
<p>Sometimes I worry that I'll never have more than an "artist's rendering" depth of knowledge on anything. Especially anything technical. But I can't help it; technical things are inspiring. Like, today, I went to the planetarium. I'm actually a new member there, at Adler. And I learned that there are 88 official constellations (as in, sanctioned by the International Astronomical Union). Every part of the sky is in exactly one constellation. Every star in the sky is located within a constellation, even if it's not part of the constellation's form. The constellations are like districts or sectors in the map of the sky, and learning about them gets you familiar with the visible objects in the sky.</p> 

<p>So, my foot in the door of learning about astronomy and cosmology. But--also an inspiration for my 2015 NaNoWriMo novel. Taking notes in the exhibits, my mind turned the stories about galaxies into stories about relationships, and about different social groups in a city. Maybe I can use these as writing prompts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot young stars at the Rosette, next store to the Horsehead</li>
<li>The Whirlpool's conflict with her neighbor has ignited her creative productivity. Neighbor,  NGC 5195</li>
<li>Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, eventually, billions of years from now. </li>
<li>NGC 1316. Several merged galaxies, with a supermassive black hole consuming its stars and gas, emitting large amount of radio waves. Like the 90s grunge scene.  </li>
<li>M87. It's supermassive black hole emits plasma jets. One is 5k light years long. How long did it take to extend to that length?</li>
<li>Bodes Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole. </li>
<li>20 dwarf galaxies orbit the Milky Way. They have billions of stars. Can be seen in the Southern Hemisphere</li>
<li>Local Group of galaxies</li>
<li>Hoags Object: The Mystery of the Ring Galaxy</li>
<li>Black Eye Galaxy - the dust orbits in the opposite direction of the stars. The victims blame themselves.</li>
<li>Mayalls Object is quite suggestive. "When two galaxies love each other very much..."</li>
<li>Coma cluster</li>
<li>ESO 510-G13- warped due to gravitational interactions with another galaxy in the past</li>
<li>Markarian Chain of Galaxies are a line of Galaxies that move together </li>
<li>Leo Triplets, the showy acrobats of spiral galaxies</li>
<li>Mice galaxies, pulling off each other's arms </li>
<li>Orion nebula, giant stellar nursery, like 1871</li>
<li>The Pleiades, nearby and known for their beauty</li>
<li>Pillars of Creation. Famous, monumental, steadily changing, being eaten away. A mashup of glaciers and the grand canyon</li>
<li>What is the cause of Cosmic Acceleration? Why are we all moving away from one another? The dark energy survey camera in Chile is supposed to help us find out by peering at the most distant galaxies. </li>
<li>Is dark matter here right now? Can one simply detect it, or must we smash atoms?</li>
<li>Will we end in deep freeze, torn apart, or crunched into oblivion?</li>
<li>Alan Guth discovered on Dec 7 1979 that the universe is expanding. </li>
<li>The light From far away galaxies is redshifted. They're all moving away from us. We Chase, always. Edwin Hubble discovered this in 1929. Hubbles  law derives distance from this shift. A light wave traveling to us stretches as the universe stretches, shifting to red. </li>
<li>Night Sky a field guide to the constellations pg 24. Existing star names are fixed, and newly discovered stars are given only a catalog number. Stars cannot be named after people, and star names are not for sale. Some unscrupulous businesses "sell" starnames and offer to name a star after you or a loved one. The only place such a name is ever recordedis in that business's own records and publications. These names are not official start names and are not recognized by any official organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then my notes took me to thoughts of there being hope that I might find meaning and purpose, even at my ripe old age. Probably had something to do with this morning's UU service on autumn, and on trusting that spring growth will come to fallow fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>We didn't know about other galaxies til the 1920s (Hubble)?? And yet Einstein went on to predict black holes in 1935.</li> <li>Cosmic web of dark matter. Backbone of the universe. Inside clumps of dark matter, galaxies form
200 million years. Dense regions of atoms collapse to trigger nuclear fusion reactions (stars). Dumb accidents, yet us intelligent beings feel like we can't do anything of significance. </li>
<li>We are stardust. From large stars, we get carbon, oxygen, phosphorous. Small stars, nitrogen and carbon. At the big bang, the lighter elements, hydrogen. All hydrogen is from then. From supernova, calcium and iron. Atoms are forged in stars.</li> 
<li>We feel insignificant but we are as old as the universe</li>
</ul>
<p>And then the rest just made me think of ESP and ghosts and UFOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If dark energy exists, it opposes gravity. </li>
<li>Normal matter is only 4% of the universe. </li>
<li>The vast majority of the mass of the universe seems to be missing.</li> 
<li>The building blocks that formed life on earth exist everywhere in the universe.</li> 
<li>What is a planetary nebula? The Cats Eye, like a crystal. A mineral talisman. </li>
</ul>
<p>I sure hope I don't get bored with this or forget the nugget of it before 11/1.</p>
