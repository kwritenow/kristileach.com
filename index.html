                    With the Access to Justice Group, I've been working on a multi-phased project to bring a re-entry resource guide from analog to digital format, working with a community partner and a volunteer team of technologists.

                    As part of my work at the Institute of Design, I began with an object I was having trouble using, a packing tape dispenser, and set out to improve it.

                    As part of my work at the Institute of Design, I designed a mobile parking application--several years before the current app was released!

                <p>
                    As part of my work at the Institute of Design, I redesigned Chicago parking meters to clarify the instructions and make parking less frustrating. We assumed the hardware would not be changed and focused on the information design.
